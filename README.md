# Utility-Launcher
An exploit to run programs via TrustedInstaller automatically! Based on Endermanch 's "Windows 10 DOS".
TO USE: Name your executable "something.exe", and the program will run it in TrustedInstaller permissions BEFORE winlogon. When your program finishes, you will go to the command prompt, and, if you want, type "win" to let the computer return to its previous state. 
**I (Tobey), am not held liable for any misuse of the Launcher.**
